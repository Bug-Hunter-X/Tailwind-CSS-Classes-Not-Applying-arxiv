# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where classes fail to apply correctly. This can stem from several causes including improper configuration, CSS conflicts, or build process errors.

## Bug

The provided JavaScript code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style a div element.  In some cases, the `bg-red-500` (red background) and `p-4` (padding) classes may not be applied, leading to unexpected visual results. This bug is reproduced under certain conditions and can be difficult to debug.

## Solution

The solution involves checking various aspects of your Tailwind CSS setup:

1. **Verify Tailwind Configuration:** Ensure your Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`) is correctly set up and includes the necessary paths for your CSS files.
2. **Purge Unused Styles:**  Use Tailwind's purging mechanism to remove unused styles from your production CSS. This helps reduce the overall CSS size and can eliminate potential conflicts.
3. **Inspect CSS Order:** Check the order in which your CSS files are loaded to ensure Tailwind CSS styles have precedence.
4. **Browser Developer Tools:** Utilize your browser's developer tools to inspect the generated CSS for the element. Look for potential style conflicts or missing styles.
5. **Check for Conflicting Styles:** Ensure no other CSS styles (from other sources) are overriding Tailwind CSS styles.
6. **Restart Development Server:** A simple restart of your development server can sometimes resolve transient issues.

The solution code provides example corrections to commonly encountered problems.
